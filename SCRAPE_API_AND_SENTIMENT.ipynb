Was denied for a month, then I put in the second round. It took I got my check 1 and a half weeks later. Then the week after that I get a notice saying I had to pay back everything plus 150 dollars due to overpayment because it was sent to Oklahoma, I had it sent to Oklahoma due to a family issue I had to tend to. I live in Texas, have a Texas license, was outta town a week and half, still did my online job searches. Now I have to pay back money plus extra just because, it's **. I don't even have a job to pay it back, they even said on the notice ignoring could result in charges and a jail sentence.</p></p><div class=\"adUnit adUnit-post-width ad-unit-post-width\"><!--Google CSI ad unit--><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;\"></ins><script>\n",

If only I could leave no stars. Absolutely worsed place ever, accidentally used them once and have been suffering ever since, never felt more thrown to the side in my life. No one will ever actually listen to what you have to say, they treat you as if you're nothing and steal, cheat, and screw you any way they can. I see pretty much every can agree, wish I had read the comments before using them, honestly would have rather, scratch for food. Sucks you can’t believe in your state when you have garbage people running things. I highly suggest swallowing your pride and going to your friends and family for help 100 times before using TWC unemployment.</p></p><div class=\"adUnit adUnit-post-width ad-unit-post-width\"><!--Google CSI ad unit--><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:inline-block;\"></ins><script>\n",

Filed for unemployment in August 18', got denied. Appealed the denial, but I worked 1 day at a job paying less than 50%, which we're not legally obligated to accept, some ** there filed a whole new claim against the company I worked 1 day at while ** up a bunch of other ** with my original claim. Received an approval of benefits for this claim in December 18', here I am in February of 19' no payment in hand, no card received in the mail, and no communication as to what the issue is. Just spent hours on the phone and was told that payment is on hold because I didn't file to the 2nd appeal tribunal when I never received any information regarding this. </p></p><div class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4689220\"><p>Asked the agent how to file this appeal and she basically said I don't know, but it's too late anyways... So I asked if she could supply me with the information anyways and she couldn't even give me this. I was told that because I only worked one day and didn't make enough money to qualify for a claim EVERYTHING would be denied. What does the one day I worked have anything to do with a job I spent 3 years at that I filed for originally? She stated basically that it is up to me to know what goes on behind the curtains within their offices and I should have been on top of it. Again, at this point I demanded the information, she said I needed to go online and file... ok, WHERE? </p><p>So now at this point it's up to me to hunt down some information that these employees should provide from the get go as a service to us taxpayers, but failed to do so because they simply don't care. THESE ** WORK FOR US, DON'T LET THEM PUNK YOU! They get paid to intentionally ** up your claim as to not have to pay out your benefits, in December I finessed one employee into admitting this on the phone, guess what... The \"recorded phone call for quality assurance purposes\" has been erased. ** TWC AND ALL OF ITS EMPLOYEES.</p></div><a class=\"exp-btn ca-a-uprcs ca-a-sm\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"View more\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-4689220\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\">\n",

What are these people paid off even after listening to the recording they should have been in my favor, the lady that fired didn't even know that my job position was. She had to put the tribunal on hold to get my employee file, 7.5yrs there and an HR that had only been there 4 months fires me, even after sexual harassment, bullying, retaliation, discrimination I still can't get unemployment.

Seems like they think they are being paid to not help people. Also, was sent a letter to come in for one hour for a required class so snap benefits would continue then told everyone that it would take a couple of hours. My daughter couldn't come in the following week to show her required job search and one of the employees left a threatening voicemail. I believe that the employees like to rub it in that they get paid for being lazy and rude.

No one called to tell me the investigation closed after two days. Two MONTHS later I call, only to find out that they forgot to call me. When I finally got to file my claim, THREE PEOPLE made errors, causing my claim to take even longer. When speaking to an agent I stated that I was pregnant, and he began interrogating me as though I am disabled, even though legally I am obligate to discuss my pregnancy. My claim was partially approved after THREE AND A HALF MONTHS.</p></p><div class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4291222\"><p>During the wait time I was driving for Rideshare part time. I was in an accident while driving Rideshare. The woman from TWC called me last week and I told her that my car is in the shop (over $10k in damage), but I did not quit. The other car I have is not eligible to drive due to the condition. Two days later, my claim is denied because \"I quit my job\". Mind you, this is not technically a job. I just am not able to log in until my car is repaired.</p><p>I spoke to a supervisor and she told me technically I quit due to personal reasons because it is my personal vehicle. Now I have to file an appeal, which takes 6-8 weeks just to get a hearing. I am a single mother and 7mos pregnant and looking for a job. This is my first time EVER requesting unemployment, and they make it beyond difficult. My car is about to go into repossession and I am about to be homeless. THANKS TO THE TEXAS WORKFORCE COMMISSION. THIS PLACE IS A JOKE, AND SO ARE THE TEXAS LAWS.</p></div><a class=\"exp-btn ca-a-uprcs ca-a-sm\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"View more\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-4291222\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\">\n",

I was awarded unemployment then my job decided to appeal this, so they made up all these false accusations making me look like the worst employee ever even tho in the 3.5 years I'd worked there I'd gotten all raises, the company awards (raises are awarded by satisfactory work over certain periods of time, like you do a good job for a year you get 50 cent raise). </p></p><div class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4284682\"><p>Well I'd gotten a raise every year yet they made me to look like I was a troubled employee which I'd been written up 3 times in nearly 4 years but they made it look like I'd been written up 9 times by triplicating all my disciplinary cases. Once I showed this to TWC along with the document from Texas Motor Vehicle Division showing I'd had no tickets in 2 years and 10 months and they had made it sound like I had gotten 3 tickets in the past year. But as I said even tho I had official documents from a state entity showing I'd had no tickets and proved they had copied the disciplinary reports 3 times each to make 3 appear to be nine, and also pointed out that I'd had 4 raises including a raise 3 months prior to being fired, and if I was such a terrible employee why did I get raises on a regular basis. </p><p>TWC didn't pay attention to the proof I submitted showing my job was lying and I was being honest, and to make sure the commissioner who had voted in my favor was replaced 2 days before my final hearing and another put in his place, well long story short it took about 20 minutes for them to find for my job completely ignoring the proof I had submitted. I couldn't believe this and worse than that was there was no recourse for me as when I was notified of their decision the 3 weeks had passed for me to request a civil court to review this. </p><p>They said I owed them 6045.00 dollars for unemployment paid and I had no job and was in the process of getting disability, the main reason I think I was fired was I had been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and hepatitis c advanced and was having to go to the doctor a lot on a regular basis and had been placed on FMLA for this but I feel they were tired of dealing with my doctor visits so they used the reason given to get rid of me. People are right. Texas Workforce Commission is a very crooked outfit with no oversight and no one to answer to. They screw you and there is nothing you can do about it. </p><p>Someone in authority needs to scrutinize them and make them follow the law and stop turning a blind eye for the rich companies taking advantage of the employee, this is a problem and once they decide you're not getting the decision in your case there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. This is robbery plain and simple by a government run office that is supposed to be there to make sure the employee gets a fair shake. I didn't lie about a single thing in my application for benefits, yet my employer took his time in appealing their decision so I would have a nice fat bill owed to TWC then followed thru. And I'm on a fixed income now and they want 250 a month payments but I can only give them 100. But like I said I proved beyond doubt I was telling the truth and my former employer was lying and committing fraud yet this didn't seem to matter. They didn't even consider my documents whatsoever.

I reported an UNSAFE WORK CONDITION to my general manager. Then to the company's Corporate Headquarters and their reply was unfortunately the unsafe condition is here to stay. I have an email right now that proves this. So I'm waiting for some more feedback on my Complaint and football season starts and we get really busy. Months roll by and I'm thinking that maybe it takes 3 to 6 months for complaints to get addressed and resolved. The unsafe work condition at first, they stopped subjecting us to. </p></p><div class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3978084\"><p>Then after a few months they started subjecting everyone to it again. The company has clearly disregarded my complaint all together. Then they use it to write me up and fire me with it. This is CLEARLY A OSHA VIOLATION. I file for unemployment and get it right away using the unsafe working condition I reported. The law says the employer has the right to contest that decision. So they do and the employer lies their ** off. Their even guilty of forgery, signing someone's names in the employees signature spot on the disciplinary reports, 7 of them. </p><p>In our tribunal phone call they lied and said I refused to sign the documents. I never EVER saw any disciplinary document's. They were manufactured by my employer just for the hearing. There is a spot for the employee to give a statement on these documents. If I had even see these documents I would have written that I reported their system as UNSAFE and dangerous. I tried to get witnesses for the tribunal but no one wanted to get involved and they didn't want to get fired for coming forward about the unsafe working condition I reported. I asked the examiner to have the employer read my unsafe working condition complaint and she said, \"WE'RE NOT GOING THERE\". I was SHOCKED!</p><p>I tried to bring up documents that the employer submitted that proved my case and the examiner wouldn't let me. None if my evidence was going to be allowed to be submitted. I was sure that the examiner had seen through some of the employer lies and I would still win. I got the answer in the mail that I had lost and have to pay back $1617 in benefits I received. I was SHOCKED AGAIN! I called OSHA,and found out the employer was guilty if firing me for reporting an unsafe work Condition but the 30 days I had to report the incident had expired. </p><p>I can prove that the TEXAS WORKFORCE COMMISSION knew and IGNORED that my employer had put me in danger by subjecting me to the unsafe work Condition I reported back in June of 2017. I just got a letter from TWC that their going to start legal action on me if I don't pay soon. These people are NOT TRUST WORTHY and employer and TWC are guilty if OSHA Violations. I am an EX-FIRE ALARM INSPECTOR, RETIRED. The pizza job was just a part-time supplementary job. This is not over, not even close. Stay away from TWC UNEMPLOYMENT UNTIL You've heard that they've been audited and found guilty.</p></div><div class=\"rvw-bd-glry js-rvw-bd-glry\" data-target-id=\"3978084\"><div class=\"rvw-bd-glry__img\" data-ca-modal-active-pic=\"1\" data-ca-modal-collection='[{\"src\": \"https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/reviews/texas-workforce-commission_389212.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": \"https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/texas-workforce-commission_389212_thumbnail.jpg\", \"name\": \"\"}, {\"title\": \"Texas Workforce Commission\"}]' data-ca-modal-type=\"gallery\" data-more-images=\"0+\"><img class=\"lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/texas-workforce-commission_389212_thumbnail.jpg\"/></div></div><a class=\"exp-btn ca-a-uprcs ca-a-sm\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"View more\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3978084\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\">\n",

The Company I was placed with is a very well established Company here in DFW; also endowed as one of Fortune 500 and best companies to work for, very good Company overall. Was very happy with the assignment, both I and the permanent staff got along great, I felt like a part of the company as a result, I did a great job, successfully completed my assignment, they were impressed with my work to the point of giving me references should I need them.</p></p><div class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3835255\"><p>Okay, as everyone now know once a temporary assignment ends, you must contact the Staffing Agency in the agency allotted time-frame for more work, or it might affect your unemployment. My assignment ended on a Friday at 5:00PM, so of course I called on Monday the next business day. To Note; When you call Resource Staffing you interact with who is available, it's not always your recruiter! On the Monday I called my recruiter was unavailable, so I provided this other recruiter my work available information, I was then transferred to my recruiter's voicemail, she called me a day later and we went over my availability, my resume as well as what work she currently had. Nothing she had was a good fit, so I kept in contact with her via email and phone as well. Went Online the Following Week Also and Input My Availability And continued to do so!!!</p><p>After not picking up work, I went ahead and file my unemployment the three days as is required by Texas Workforce, waited for it to be processed and received payment. After a couple of weeks and not received payment I called TWC and was told they are still waiting on my job. Okay, No worries they have certain time-frame to respond to new claims. I continued to wait! Knowing I did nothing wrong I expected to be paid! To my surprise Resource Staffing DENIED MY UNEMPLOYMENT; Told the TWC that I QUIT MY JOB/NEVER MADE MYSELF AVAIL FOR MORE WORK I at no time quit my job!!!! They claim I didn't go online in enough time to input my availability. But I was denied unemployment!!! This unethical and against the guidelines they set as well as TWC's.</p></div><a class=\"exp-btn ca-a-uprcs ca-a-sm\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"View more\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3835255\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\">\n",

I was also told that we would get interviewed while we were in class training for our job but nothing, I wasn't even able to learn anything either. I wasted a month at school when I could of found a job instead. I was left with no career or job like I was promised. When I was done I had to still go extra to class to get my CDL but I had no more money from my unemployment so I had to find a part time job. When I spoke to my career coach I explained to her why or how I need money and I was not able to continue my education until I found a job. She told me or acted as if she did not care and wanted me to go to finish even though I told her I have bills and rent and I had to help my roommate. </p></p><div class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3830710\"><p>I even explained if I can find a part time job then I can go back to finish but she said no, and if I ever find another job then that was that and I was no longer going to get the help I needed by the workforce, and she said if she were to known she would of never put me on the program but I told her I was sorry that at least let me get a part time job to finish and she made it seem as if I was my fault if the program was canceled and she also told me all my records of employers will no longer be if I got a part time job or another job. And so she encouraged me to get a Mechanic job instead, But felt as if I made a mistake. And little did I known that the help I was going to get for my CDL was no longer there. I explained that it’s difficult to find a heavy duty mechanic job if she can help me but no help at all. Unfortunately I will have to continue my CDL education on my own. Workforce failed my satisfaction and I was not able to become a diesel Mechanic.</p></div><a class=\"exp-btn ca-a-uprcs ca-a-sm\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"View more\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3830710\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\">\n",

I received unemployment for a while, and I had been driving for Uber part-time for a year prior to getting fired from the FT job. When I reported earnings for Uber one week and then not the next, my unemployment benefits stopped. I appealed it and told them that I didn't quit Uber. They told me that they viewed not working as quitting. I argued that I didn't quit and I still work for them when work is available (like special events in town). TWC still takes the stance that I quit and now I have to repay the money they paid me during my unemployment. Lesson learned: LIE. Do not report your earnings from Uber or rideshare driving. I was honest about reporting my earnings and it bit me in the butt.</p></p></div><div class=\"rvw-foot\"><div class=\"rvw-foot__fdbck js-helpful-link hidden-no-js\" data-track-goal=\"profile:helpful_usr_acq_btn:click\"><input name=\"helpful\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"helpful\"/><label for=\"helpful\"><svg height=\"14\" viewbox=\"0 0 15 14\" width=\"15\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M14.903 8.356c-.019-.445-.237-.794-.417-1.008.209-.474.29-1.22-.407-1.8-.51-.425-1.375-.615-2.575-.562-.843.035-1.548.178-1.577.184a12.73 12.73 0 0 0-.507.094c-.013-.187.023-.653.401-1.701.449-1.247.423-2.202-.083-2.84C9.206.053 8.356 0 8.106 0a.84.84 0 0 0-.62.258c-.355.377-.313 1.074-.269 1.396-.423 1.037-1.609 3.578-2.613 4.283-.019.012-.035.027-.05.041a3.136 3.136 0 0 0-.63.861 1.425 1.425 0 0 0-.634-.146H1.334C.596 6.693 0 7.24 0 7.91v4.757c0 .673.6 1.218 1.334 1.218H3.29c.285 0 .551-.082.77-.223l.753.082c.115.015 2.167.252 4.274.214.381.026.74.041 1.074.041.574 0 1.074-.04 1.491-.123.981-.19 1.651-.57 1.991-1.13.26-.427.26-.852.218-1.121.638-.527.75-1.11.728-1.52a1.832 1.832 0 0 0-.131-.588c.314-.366.465-.758.445-1.162z\" fill=\"#3E3D3F\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg>\n",

I have so far done everything that I am required to do, as far as job searching and payment request. I was recently contacted in regards for further questioning of my former employment for my benefits. I don’t quite agree with the way I was being spoken to. I don’t mind being asked 1 million questions, but I don’t like the fact that I am being questioned and sarcastically replied to as I if I am some lowlife that wants to live off the government for free. </p></p><div class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3664981\"><p>I was at my former employer for almost 4 years, I resigned for personal issues along with medical conditions that are temporary. I have been searching for jobs that meet my medical restriction requirements in the meantime to keep me afloat financially. Although I have yet to be successful at finding a job, I am searching for the benefit of me not and just to meet some requirements for the Texas Workforce Commission. All I am asking is to be treated and spoken to a little more professionally. As being a detention officer of my former employer, working with inmates, I have learned a treat everybody equally no matter who or where they come from and a matter what their convictions are. If I was able to maintain a professional stature of my former employer, why can’t someone else be able to do the same over a phone call. I’m sure those were their job requirements.</p></div><a class=\"exp-btn ca-a-uprcs ca-a-sm\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"View more\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3664981\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\">\n",

Shut these places down, hire trained professionals, change laws to protect us employees, and get more support for us working Americans!!!</p></div><a class=\"exp-btn ca-a-uprcs ca-a-sm\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"View more\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3428062\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\">\n",

I talked to a person at Texas Workforce Commission and told them very, very specifically that I did not know if I qualified for unemployment and that I did NOT want to be in a position where I would get benefits and then have them come back and say I owed them money. I was assured repeatedly that if qualified, I would owe the state of Texas nothing. So... they approved me without contacting my former employer first, paid me $7000 in benefits... and then came back saying my claim was denied and guess what... I owed them $7000. </p></p><div class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3346921\"><p>I am now (2017/2018) unemployed by means of lay off, have full approval for unemployment from my former employer, and in danger of losing my home because TWC refused to admit they made a mistake and lied to me. My personal review of the Texas Workforce Commission and their unemployment compensation program is that you cannot trust them. They will lie, they will distort the facts, and they are an uncaring, irrational, bloated, under regulated agency that needs a FULL house cleaning from top to bottom.</p></div><a class=\"exp-btn ca-a-uprcs ca-a-sm\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"View more\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3346921\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\">\n",

In December of 2003 I was living in a garage apt and I got married. The living situation was not good and I moved. The person I rented from did not hold my mail and in that letter from 2004, it said I needed to call them on March 31st. I had called and given them my new address but they had already mailed the February letter, needless to say, I missed the March phone call and they turned the unemployment I had received from September 2003 to January 2004 into overpayments. I filled an appeal in October of 2017 as soon as I found out. Had my telephone conference on Nov 3rd with them and explained that I never got the letter. The packet I received about a week before the hearing States file not found.</p><p>I explained at the end of the phone conversation that I would not have intentionally NOT called them and explained I was turning sixty and raising my grandchild. I also explained that in August of 2017 they found a brain tumor and that in Sept of 2017, I had to have gamma knife radiation. He said it normally takes up to 10 business days but that this would only take a few days, he also gave me a number to call to check on the status of my claim, (now that's a joke cause you never get a human). Today November 15th, 2017 they have denied my appeal stating that they are upholding their decision from 2004 because I did not file a timely appeal. So I'll now lose everything and on top of that they want me to pay them over 4,000.00 dollars in overpayment. I AM A HUMAN BEING. I AM NOT A NUMBER AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IT'S HORRIBLE.</p></div><a class=\"exp-btn ca-a-uprcs ca-a-sm\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"View more\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3037168\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\">\n",

Since I followed all the rules and the agency had not been able to place me in a new position by the end of June, I assumed my benefits would be an easy thing to get. </p></p><div class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2792851\"><p>I got a voicemail message to call case worker \"Debbie\" to discuss my case and did so immediately, twice. When she finally called back days later, I honestly thought I was speaking to a robotic automated message at first. Having been in customer service for over 20 years, I know how to speak to someone on the phone, especially when that person is going thru a difficult time. You must show empathy and compassion. It became immediately obvious to me that no one monitors the case worker phone calls because this woman is really rude and condescending. I am sure she has never heard of the word compassion.</p><p>On this first call she asked me why I turned down a \"job offer\" from the staffing agency in the 2nd week of June. I was confused because I had not received any job offers. She repeated the question with more impatience. I finally realized she was talking about a call I had received from the agency supervisor where she herself said, \"You probably don't want to consider this job because it's almost 20 miles from your home, is temporary, and pays only $11-12 an hour.\" I had been receiving $17 an hour as an Administrative Specialist and drove 10 minutes to the job site so I did tell her \"No, thank you.\" </p><p>At this point Debbie said, \"So you turned down this job offer because it was farther than you wanted to travel or was it the money?” I answered \"Both\" which really seemed to anger her. She then lectured me about how she commutes 45 minutes every day and I shouldn't be turning down a job offer just because it wasn't the same money I had been receiving. I tried to tell her that making $11 an hour while commuting for more than an hour would end up netting me minimum wage after gas and car expenses, and that I would risk being late to work every day. Then I explained to her that the staffing agency was not offering me employment, but simply letting me know there was an opening. She told me they considered it a job referral or job offer. </p><p>How insane is it that a case worker in this line of work doesn't know the difference? The outcome of that upsetting call was that she only awarded me 1 week of benefits instead of the 2 weeks I deserved. I am not a weepy sort of person but I really cried after that call. To be at such a low point in my life and be spoken to as if I was doing something wrong is truly awful. Shameful treatment of someone who has worked all her life and now finds herself in very depressing time.</p><p>On July 16 I requested benefits online and truthfully reported that I had been offered a job on July 11, but it was for part-time and no benefits. I wrote in great detail that I was also interviewed on July 11 by another company with a good full-time position with benefits. I turned down the part-time job because I was about to have a 2nd and 3rd interview with the other company and getting this full-time job was very promising. Unfortunately the employer said they had to put a hold on hiring and that I should check back in September or October. I continued my job search but I’m still unemployed and continued to request benefits. I received benefits the rest of July and well into August.</p><p>On August 29 I was forced to speak to Debbie again. I had no clue why she would be calling. Come to find out she was asking me to explain myself regarding turning down the part-time job. It took her 44 days to get around to following up. She never bothered to read my online explanation so I repeated what happened. She asked, \"Are you working now?\" I could feel the anger rising in me again because this woman does not listen to me, but I stayed calm and said, \"No. Like I said, the job has been put on hold.\" She abruptly finished the call in her robotic tone so I thought I could get back to finding a job with a little bit of unemployment benefits to help pay for my gas, cell phone bill, and some groceries.</p><p>The next day I was shocked to find that I received several notices from TX Workforce Commission. What now? The first stated I had been disqualified from benefits because I turned down employment. The next notice stated I was overpaid $1,868 and that I would not be receiving any further benefits until I paid them back. The 3rd notice was a payment coupon with instructions to send the check for $1,868 immediately. I was in complete disbelief! </p><p>This is what telling the truth got me. I wrote my appeal immediately and stated why it made no financial sense for me to accept the part-time job that would net me $149.50 a week after taxes and Obamacare medical insurance. I can't help support my family with that paycheck. I also mentioned that at no time was I told that if I turned down any offer of employment no matter how minimal that I would be disqualified for unemployment benefits. </p><p>I included \"This wouldn't have been an issue if Debbie had done her job in a timely manner and not waited over 6 weeks to call me\". I ended it by stating I am unable to pay them because I am unemployed. Jeez, duh! So she was able to add more misery to my life and I'm sure she slept just fine afterward. After reading the comments on this ConsumerAffairs website I realize I will undoubtedly lose my appeal. </p>\n",

      "                            I did nothing wrong and I deserved those benefits. I have been killing myself sending out my resume, calling and writing prospective employers, joining 2 more staffing agencies, and going on interviews that end in the same \"Sorry\" answer. It is getting harder and harder to stay upbeat and positive. It is so depressing.<p>By the way, according to the mission statement on the TX Workforce Commission site they are committed to \"Promote and support a workforce system that creates value and offers the individual the opportunity to achieve and sustain economic prosperity\". Nothing could be further than the truth!</p></div><a class=\"exp-btn ca-a-uprcs ca-a-sm\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"View more\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-2792851\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\">\n",

I had to quit my job as my wife moved and got a new career job and because we have been taking care of a terminally ill person in our immediate family every day. Those are two qualifying items and I VERIFIED WITH THE commission before quitting. To make a story short, they denied my request and appeal. Straight up liars. It's also impossible to get into contact with anyone. In the meantime I've decided to start a 4 year college degree because I am still young, and I've got a lot of money in a savings account. I'm not too angry because of that, but I can never rely on Texas giving me a boost to find another job because of impossible circumstances.</p></p></div><div class=\"rvw-foot\"><div class=\"rvw-foot__fdbck js-helpful-link hidden-no-js\" data-track-goal=\"profile:helpful_usr_acq_btn:click\"><input name=\"helpful\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"helpful\"/><label for=\"helpful\"><svg height=\"14\" viewbox=\"0 0 15 14\" width=\"15\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M14.903 8.356c-.019-.445-.237-.794-.417-1.008.209-.474.29-1.22-.407-1.8-.51-.425-1.375-.615-2.575-.562-.843.035-1.548.178-1.577.184a12.73 12.73 0 0 0-.507.094c-.013-.187.023-.653.401-1.701.449-1.247.423-2.202-.083-2.84C9.206.053 8.356 0 8.106 0a.84.84 0 0 0-.62.258c-.355.377-.313 1.074-.269 1.396-.423 1.037-1.609 3.578-2.613 4.283-.019.012-.035.027-.05.041a3.136 3.136 0 0 0-.63.861 1.425 1.425 0 0 0-.634-.146H1.334C.596 6.693 0 7.24 0 7.91v4.757c0 .673.6 1.218 1.334 1.218H3.29c.285 0 .551-.082.77-.223l.753.082c.115.015 2.167.252 4.274.214.381.026.74.041 1.074.041.574 0 1.074-.04 1.491-.123.981-.19 1.651-.57 1.991-1.13.26-.427.26-.852.218-1.121.638-.527.75-1.11.728-1.52a1.832 1.832 0 0 0-.131-.588c.314-.366.465-.758.445-1.162z\" fill=\"#3E3D3F\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg>\n",

I was awarded unemployment then my job decided to appeal this, so they made up all these false accusations making me look like the worst employee ever even tho in the 3.5 years I'd worked there I'd gotten all raises, the company awards (raises are awarded by satisfactory work over certain periods of time, like you do a good job for a year you get 50 cent raise). Well I'd gotten a raise every year yet they made me to look like I was a troubled employee which I'd been written up 3 times in nearly 4 years but they made it look like I'd been written up 9 times by triplicating all my disciplinary cases. Once I showed this to TWC along with the document from Texas Motor Vehicle Division showing I'd had no tickets in 2 years and 10 months and they had made it sound like I had gotten 3 tickets in the past year. But as I said even tho I had official documents from a state entity showing I'd had no tickets and proved they had copied the disciplinary reports 3 times each to make 3 appear to be nine, and also pointed out that I'd had 4 raises including a raise 3 months prior to being fired, and if I was such a terrible employee why did I get raises on a regular basis. TWC didn't pay attention to the proof I submitted showing my job was lying and I was being honest, and to make sure the commissioner who had voted in my favor was replaced 2 days before my final hearing and another put in his place, well long story short it took about 20 minutes for them to find for my job completely ignoring the proof I had submitted. I couldn't believe this and worse than that was there was no recourse for me as when I was notified of their decision the 3 weeks had passed for me to request a civil court to review this. They said I owed them 6045.00 dollars for unemployment paid and I had no job and was in the process of getting disability, the main reason I think I was fired was I had been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and hepatitis c advanced and was having to go to the doctor a lot on a regular basis and had been placed on FMLA for this but I feel they were tired of dealing with my doctor visits so they used the reason given to get rid of me. People are right. Texas Workforce Commission is a very crooked outfit with no oversight and no one to answer to. They screw you and there is nothing you can do about it. Someone in authority needs to scrutinize them and make them follow the law and stop turning a blind eye for the rich companies taking advantage of the employee, this is a problem and once they decide you're not getting the decision in your case there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. This is robbery plain and simple by a government run office that is supposed to be there to make sure the employee gets a fair shake.

Since I followed all the rules and the agency had not been able to place me in a new position by the end of June, I assumed my benefits would be an easy thing to get. I got a voicemail message to call case worker \"Debbie\" to discuss my case and did so immediately, twice. When she finally called back days later, I honestly thought I was speaking to a robotic automated message at first. Having been in customer service for over 20 years, I know how to speak to someone on the phone, especially when that person is going thru a difficult time. You must show empathy and compassion. It became immediately obvious to me that no one monitors the case worker phone calls because this woman is really rude and condescending. I am sure she has never heard of the word compassion.On this first call she asked me why I turned down a \"job offer\" from the staffing agency in the 2nd week of June. I was confused because I had not received any job offers. She repeated the question with more impatience. I finally realized she was talking about a call I had received from the agency supervisor where she herself said, \"You probably don\\'t want to consider this job because it\\'s almost 20 miles from your home, is temporary, and pays only $11-12 an hour.\" I had been receiving $17 an hour as an Administrative Specialist and drove 10 minutes to the job site so I did tell her \"No, thank you.\" At this point Debbie said, \"So you turned down this job offer because it was farther than you wanted to travel or was it the money?” I answered \"Both\" which really seemed to anger her. She then lectured me about how she commutes 45 minutes every day and I shouldn\\'t be turning down a job offer just because it wasn\\'t the same money I had been receiving. I tried to tell her that making $11 an hour while commuting for more than an hour would end up netting me minimum wage after gas and car expenses, and that I would risk being late to work every day. Then I explained to her that the staffing agency was not offering me employment, but simply letting me know there was an opening. She told me they considered it a job referral or job offer. How insane is it that a case worker in this line of work doesn\\'t know the difference? The outcome of that upsetting call was that she only awarded me 1 week of benefits instead of the 2 weeks I deserved. I am not a weepy sort of person but I really cried after that call. To be at such a low point in my life and be spoken to as if I was doing something wrong is truly awful. Shameful treatment of someone who has worked all her life and now finds herself in very depressing time.On July 16 I requested benefits online and truthfully reported that I had been offered a job on July 11, but it was for part-time and no benefits. I wrote in great detail that I was also interviewed on July 11 by another company with a good full-time position with benefits. I turned down the part-time job because I was about to have a 2nd and 3rd interview with the other company and getting this full-time job was very promising. Unfortunately the employer said they had to put a hold on hiring and that I should check back in September or October. I continued my job search but I’m still unemployed and continued to request benefits. I received benefits the rest of July and well into August.On August 29 I was forced to speak to Debbie again. I had no clue why she would be calling. Come to find out she was asking me to explain myself regarding turning down the part-time job. It took her 44 days to get around to following up. She never bothered to read my online explanation so I repeated what happened. She asked, \"Are you working now?\" I could feel the anger rising in me again because this woman does not listen to me, but I stayed calm and said, \"No. Like I said, the job has been put on hold.\" She abruptly finished the call in her robotic tone so I thought I could get back to finding a job with a little bit of unemployment benefits to help pay for my gas, cell phone bill, and some groceries.The next day I was shocked to find that I received several notices from TX Workforce Commission. What now? The first stated I had been disqualified from benefits because I turned down employment. The next notice stated I was overpaid $1,868 and that I would not be receiving any further benefits until I paid them back. The 3rd notice was a payment coupon with instructions to send the check for $1,868 immediately. I was in complete disbelief! This is what telling the truth got me. I wrote my appeal immediately and stated why it made no financial sense for me to accept the part-time job that would net me $149.50 a week after taxes and Obamacare medical insurance. I can\\'t help support my family with that paycheck. I also mentioned that at no time was I told that if I turned down any offer of employment no matter how minimal that I would be disqualified for unemployment benefits. I included \"This wouldn\\'t have been an issue if Debbie had done her job in a timely manner and not waited over 6 weeks to call me\". I ended it by stating I am unable to pay them because I am unemployed. Jeez, duh! So she was able to add more misery to my life and I\\'m sure she slept just fine afterward.

TWC immediately terminated all UI benefits on grounds that I \"was not actively seeking employment.\" My mistake was truthfully reporting my actions. Next, I accepted a job at a Texas nursing home. The agreement was for part-time work with training to pass the required state board exams. But all I did was lift obese residents - all day. The nursing home never provided any training and scheduled me for 60 hour weeks. Of course the hours over 40 per week were carefully scheduled to prevent overtime.Luckily, I found other work, but the damage was already done. TWC called the nursing home and allegedly spoke to a \"manager\" who claimed that I quit because, \"I made more $$$ sitting at home.\" TWC used these unsubstantiated statements to award themselves $2300 in overpayments. These overpayments are based on a time period which preceded the training class and the brief period where I was \"employed\" by the nursing home. Note, as soon as I reported taking a class, UI benefits ceased.TWC supposedly spoke to someone from the nursing home, but were totally unable to verify exactly who this person was. It could have been anyone, from anywhere. TWC ruled against my appeal (big surprise) and had 3 years in which to garnish wages or seize bank accounts. TWC took no action until 2016.

If it wasn\\'t for a lady in Austin who I contacted in desperation to get me into the TWC system, I may have never received the benefits I was qualified for. Also the Work in Texas website was then a complete joke. With so many glitches it was virtually non-functional... and often jobs I found there were outdated or had expired but were still shown as viable opportunities. And recently I found it to be not much better now. Often jobs are listed through \"employment agencies\" which in my experience are also a joke. I never got a job through one. And I tried many times.Back in the day, in the 1970\\'s and 80\\'s it was called the Texas Employment Commission, and you could go in and register for work/job even if you were not filling for unemployment and be contacted by them saying some company has requested you for a job interview THE SAME DAY. But there were still jobs in America than before the enactment of NAFTA and all our jobs went to China and India.Now called the \"Texas Workforce Commission\" as it is now called... is a cafeteria style \"serve yourself\"... \"we\\'ll show you how\" to find a job using their pitiful website... only to be directed to \"employment agencies\" who have no jobs to begin with. Instead of having potential employers with all these jobs they say are available to give you a call because you\\'re unemployed. Which is what the former TWC entity the \"Texas Employment Commission\" use to do, and the TEC was very effective at matching available jobs with people who were actively seeking work. I got several jobs through the TEC but never got a job through the TWC. So what is the point of having the TWC?So what are these people at TWC really doing to find people work? If they are only going to show you how to use their ridiculous job search website using a computer and tell you there are 10 different types of formats for a job resume and other novice job seeking information most people had acquired by the end of High School. Skills many experienced workers who while currently unemployed have had for many years. I can do the same thing at any library, or on any computer, since I have extensive work experience and job finding skills IF there were any jobs to find which fit my skill sets. I could find a job.TWC/ Employment Solutions seems to operate on the assumption that there are plenty of jobs to go around for all and that if you don\\'t have a job or can\\'t find a job, that it must be because you are not smart enough to find a job or lack jobs skills required to be hired for a job. And not that there is a marked lack of jobs in America today. I never had any problems finding work in my life until the year 2000 or so, 20 years ago I could find 10 jobs a day every day if I had wanted to do so. Back then and for many years the DFW Texas area was one of the top 10 job markets in the world.So now TWC/Employment Solutions is going to make me go through their ridiculous job search/ job finding skills program for 4 weeks to retain my SNAP benefits on the assumption that I am a brainless loser who 1. has no marketable skills and 2. doesn\\'t know how to find employment/lacks job search skills. My point being that if there are jobs... Where are they? Do THEY know? Do THEY have a magic JOBS WAND? No of course they don\\'t. Otherwise why are so many people unemployed? Again my point being IF there are jobs... why aren\\'t they matching people up with these jobs like the Texas Employment Commission use to do?Instead of assuming that unemployed people on SNAP or any welfare don\\'t have marketable jobs skills and or otherwise don\\'t have job search, interview/resume skills? It is my opinion that the Texas State monies spent on TWC programs and personnel salaries are largely wasted, because as far as my personal experience with TWC ... I have not been well served by TWC and can\\'t see exactly what their true function actually is, if they don\\'t match employers with job to offer with people that need jobs as their primary goal. I think if someone were to do some deep research on TWC they most certainly would find that it is in fact a truly ineffective state agency that needs a major efficiency overhaul and deep funding cuts.

Write it very clearly in logical sequence, and if you were a very good employee, make sure that they know how good you were. Then fight for what is yours!Don't expect that the Hearing Officer will have even read or reviewed the details of your case, because many of them do not even care, and they start the hearing not even knowing what it is about. They are ready to side with the employer and deny anyone their benefits if they can find a way. They can ignore all the evidence in your case for no reason, like they did in my case. I was fired for using a clean, safe and non-toxic plastic jug to serve tea. I was fired without any warning and for no reason. I explained my case very well in writing (twice).The Hearing Officer was an irrational, over-emotional, rude woman who was yelling at me and badgering me during the phone hearing. My employer was not even arguing with me, the Hearing Officer was arguing with me and attacking me. I had difficulty even presenting my evidence, and she even threatened to throw out my evidence for no reason at all. My evidence was quite excellent and my employer had no legal evidence of any kind.Get a lawyer lined up for the phone hearing as soon as possible! Your lawyer can stop them from denying you for no reason, like they did in my case. There are affordable unemployment lawyers who will charge a flat rate of $350 for one phone hearing. Make sure you get a lawyer and come out fighting, because even if you are right and did not have misconduct, and did not break any workplace policies, they will deny you because they can, and they probably make a profit from denying people their benefits.The unemployment benefits process has become very biased and TWC Hearing Officers are frequently taking sides with the employer. The government funds for unemployment benefits are set to expire by Jan. 1st, and that may be why they are denying so many cases for no reason. I'm not sure how long this has been going on, but it did not used to be this way.I had a right to a fair hearing, and I had a right to receive my unemployment benefits like anyone else who qualifies and did not have any misconduct related to work. Start with a lawyer and it will be over very quickly. Otherwise it will be too late, and it will be difficult to find a lawyer who will take your case (unless you have money), and unemployed people are usually quite broke. \\n                    View more\\n                \", 'label': 'neutral', 'neg_prob': 0.5223432578584559, 'neutral_prob': 0.5787343751444319, 'pos_prob': 0.4776567421415441}, 97: {'text': \"Original review: Nov. 19, 2013Fired from my employer where she does not know how the tell the truth.

The company said I had a bad attitude from day 1, but they kept me for my energy. That I was young. I'm a 30 year old woman, in a college town, and we have about 30k residents. They also gave me a $.50 raise. I was making $8.50 which is $1.25 more than minimum wage when I got the raise. This is a family run business. Mom, dad, 2 sons, and a daughter. They said I had been given verbal warnings which I had not. They said I was disrespectful to other employees, which is also not true. They gave a management promotion, and said I needed to learn how to manage people and that counseling would help, so to appease them I tried to go to counseling, which I found out does not help you learn how to manage people. They used that against me, and said I had anger problems and that they were trying to work with me because I was young and energetic. I was there for over a year. I was never written up for attitude problems. I got a traffic violation which technically is against company policy, but I let them know about it and they wrote me up, but didn't say I could possibly lose my job.

I believe not only in avoiding straddling the gray line between right and wrong, but staying as far away from it on the right side as possible. Last year, the week of Christmas, the TWC unilaterally threw out every legal opinion of our years long battle regarding a contractor vs. employee decision they even admitted we were following appropriately. The result was a bureaucrat in Austin determined without warning he would make an example of us and he put liens on our bank accounts. This did two things: closed our hospice business overnight and caused our payroll to bounce at Christmas. When I finally found the right person by phone I was treated with condescension and berated to a level of absolute humiliation. My wonderful wife let me find every dollar we had so we could make those paychecks good for the staff, but we now face the loss of our home and everything else in addition to the business. I asked the fellow in Austin if he had kids and he said he did. So then I inquired what exactly we were supposed to tell our son and the children of the dozens of families who just lost their job (and pay check because we had not yet had time to go get the money). He actually told me “I don’t care”.The TWC clearly does a good job for thousands of workers every year, but if you get on their bad side as a worker or employer, you can forget it. We have been denied any opportunity for appeal and now they have liens on our home, our personal bank accounts, and anything else they could find of any value. Of course, they know very well they have taken everything we have so we can never pay the ridiculous amount of money we really don't owe and no attorney we have found is willing to take us on contingency because it could amount to career suicide. Just know the pendulum swings both ways, and without some form of miracle, my family is about to pay an enormous price even though we can quickly and clearly prove we were one of the most legally conscientious business owners the TWC will ever encounter. If anyone has any suggestions, I have tossed my ego long ago and am fully willing to beg, borrow, and plead to get this anchor off from around my neck.

She stormed to the office and told all the managers that she was unconformable with me saying that. The managers jumped all over me and falsely accused me for harassing her. They tried to make me sign a blank sheet of paper to agree to harassing her. They told me to stay 1000 ft away from her as if I was a sex offender off the streets.

I was doing like anyone with common sense and hospitality to speak and ask a simple question that is not nearly harassing anyone. When I tried to collect unemployment TWC told me that the human resource manager said that the reason why I quit was because he told me to cease and detest from stalking a female employee. This was a straight out lie because he never said anything about stalking no one ever. This man was delusional. However, TWC act as they could care less about being falsely accused and allowing them to call me a stalker. I went to all three levels of appeal and neither one of them cared about my case. The only thing they kept saying is that I quit and I didn't qualify for unemployment benefits. I spent 10 months looking for work and claiming my wages to TWC just to be turned down. My employer failed me for not allowing me to tell my side of the story. I even wrote Poly-America CEO and he just ignored me completely.

There are more than 10 independent apartments under its management. The apartment I worked for is one of them. Following is my appeal to TWC's decision that rejected my unemployment benefit. In the past, I had been verbally disrespected or bullied by the manager. The manager very often took advantage of the event of argument or dispute between tenant and me to verbally abuse or bully me. (Ming ** has much intensive argument with resident many times too. Did he always get perfect ending? If he dares to point out which one was created by my fault, I can rebate right away. If I do my job trying to understand and solve the problem, supervisor always questions me about what I am doing. Do you think the job is too hard to handle or I’m not able to handle it? If I am incompetent to handle the job, why did you hire me and let me do this job over four years?)The actual event is coming from tenant who irrationally argued about one word I greeted her with at an annual re-certification (Did you rent or sell the house?) and later she questioned me “Who told you I owned a house?” She threatened me to admit that I did say something wrong at last. During this event, I had a disagreement with the manager that he called me to write a report as the same as tenant does. I rejected because it's never been done with paper report to solve dispute with tenant. His purpose, again, was try to catch an obvious evidence with main office to find a reason to fire me. Writing the report or not will contribute to the same result; let alone Mr. ** had talked with the tenant for one hour. If he is really capable in doing his job, this event should have been solved within a few minutes. Unfortunately, he does not really want to solve it, but he took advantage to make a fuss about it.I was required to go to the main office, and a meeting took place between my self, the manager, and the manager’s supervisor in the main office. This supervisor of main office was unable to reasonably resolve the issue to my satisfaction stating that was my intention to quit the job just because I don't want to stay further for meaningless discussion. I got termination from main office right after I got back to the office for the following reasons: violation of company policy, performance/neglect of duty. Please take a look at the case, the maintenance personnel Mr. ** got injured while working.All of the insurance staff and doctor of work compensation department recognized 8 weeks to recover. However, it took more than one year to pay him. At the beginning, Mr. ** also wanted him to leave the company. And Mr. ** did not get any punishment for his neglect and went out to eat lunch when Mr. ** loaded air conditioner into the truck and got injured. Reason for the decision: Our investigation found your employer fired you because your actions amounted to insubordination. This is considered misconduct connected with the work (11-11-12). You seem to tell me a story that a person waiting for a long time tries to rape you. Finally, he finds a chance to tell you “The house is so hot. Why not take off your clothes and trousers to be cooled?” and you answer him “How about taking off underwear as well? Or, are you challenging me, after four years of stay in this company, that I still don’t know how to handle situation in this little apartment?”Regarding to Houston Housing Management Corporation, since they can only support whatever the apartment managers intention to survive; otherwise, the apartment may find another management company and pay some $2,000 a month. They both just maintain a mutual benefit relationship. This is the reason why Linda still listened to Ming ** to fire me, even after I gave following document to her. “What do you guys think? I feel a bit disappointed of how Linda has been handling the matter. I think I could do a better job than her if I was allowed to do it in free hand.” Linda ** and Ming ** should exchange position to each other; otherwise, I think this is no more than a joke. There are jokes under their management. The only serious attitude is that you as an employee are not allowed to against their will or intention a little bit. Because they build an empire, they are the king or king of king; others are nothing. If I can say, I would also say by this way (but, please don’t mind, it’s a joke, too). I feel very disappointed about how Linda ** and Ming ** have been handling the matter. I believe I could do a better job than they do if I was allowed to do it in free hand. Whatever they did and felt proud of are just a ** for their own pleasures only. Reason for Decision: Our investigation found you were not available for work for personal reasons (11-17-12).I live inside the apartment where I worked for. I have been living here for four years. Am I not able to apply unemployment benefit by wrongfully terminated when I am packing to leave? How could you think I can pack and can look for the job at the same time?

I have been trying to collect Unemployment Benefits due to having to quit my job in Texas to relocate to the State of Tennessee with my spouse. I was penalized 6 weeks because of this, which I fully understand although I do not feel is just. I registered for work with the State of TN when we arrived here in February. Not being familiar with the area, I registered online. Every two weeks I requested payment with Texas and was of course was denied until the 6-week penalty period was over. During this time, I had no idea that registering online was unacceptable. To which State that is unacceptable to I'm not quite sure.Finally after 6 weeks, I received a check for one week of benefits from Texas. I then received a letter stating that I had not registered for work with the State of Tennessee and that I had to repay this money to Texas. Not sure how Texas was told this but they were told. I immediately called Texas Teleserv and was told that I had to register for work (in person) with Tennessee. I do not see that requirement stated on either State's website and I was never told this before. Becoming aware of it, that same day I went to an office here in Nashville and registered for work. I called Texas Teleserv again and notified them that I had in fact registered with Tennessee (in person). I assumed Texas would be notified that I had registered with Tennessee as previously Tennessee had told them I had not.I asked the woman at the TN Unemployment office the day I registered for work, when they would notify Texas that I had registered. She did not know, said that was something that I would need to ask Texas. When I got back home I called the Texas Teleserv and notified them that I in fact registered in Tennessee. I was told to continue to request payment by calling the Texas Teleserv phone number bi-weekly and I would receive benefits when I became eligible again. I waited two more weeks until requesting payment again on April 22, 2012 and again I have been denied! I am not understanding why I am still ineligible when I fully deserve these benefits. I have done everything I know to do. Texas and Tennessee have two sets of rules and I do not know where else to turn.Every move I make is not the correct one. The Unemployment offices in these two States do not communicate, they have their own way of doing things and for people, such as myself who quit a job to relocate with my spouse in pursuit of a better life, should not be made to walk an obviously invisible line. There is nothing in writing anywhere that advises a person on how they are to seek unemployment benefits when moving across State lines. I have been in constant contact with Texas Teleserv. I have registered for work in Tennessee. I have requested payment faithfully every two weeks. I desperately need these benefits. Moving to Tennessee was supposed to be a positive move, yet as I wait for these two offices to decide to communicate, we are falling farther and farther behind on our bills. If I knew exactly what I need to do in order to receive the unemployment benefits that I am rightly entitled to, I will definitely do it.\\n                    View more\\n                \", 'label': 'neutral', 'neg_prob': 0.650462059657591, 'neutral_prob': 0.8172998883622796, 'pos_prob': 0.3495379403424091}, 129: {'text': \"Original review: April 23, 2012In Nov. 2011, my father suffered a horrible life changing stroke.

I was urged to do this by TWC, so I was receiving unemployment benefits and working part time while continuing to look for full time permanent employment. Then, suddenly, both my parents were admitted to intensive care in a hospital. I had to go to Florida to make their medical decisions and care for their affairs. My father could not speak because he was on a ventilator and my mother had a stroke which left her unable to speak. Meanwhile, I was taking the time to continue my job search and applying for jobs where my parents were located as per my agreement with Texas Unemployment so I could still receive my unemployment check. But yes, I had to separate from the part time job as it was well over a thousand miles from where my parents were. I applied for emergency family leave at the part time job. However, when this company (part time employer) was contacted by TWC about my separation, they turned around and told TWC that I quit. Apparently, I had not worked a full year when both my parents were dying in ICU. So by letter of the law, they did not have to grant me emergency family medical leave. So their response to Texas\\' separation inquiry was to tell TWC that I quit.  Now, Texas wants their unemployment money back from when I had to go to Florida to care for my dying parents. So I filed an appeal. And I lost my appeal. Apparently, the company that says you quit (or says anything they want), gets believed by TWC and TWC upholds this even when the company doesn\\'t participate in the appeal (i.e., show up or appear via phone for the hearing.)

Okay, I understand letter of the law, even if I think it is unfair to screw someone when they are in an impossible situation. I just sent my first payment back to TX today. But I am really dissatisfied with the whole appeal holding up the part time employers statement that I quit. I even sent in a copy of the medical leave request that hospital staff signed. But that wasn\\'t good enough. Apparently I \"separated\" from employment, period. Letter of the law. Did I mention that I am still unemployed and they are sucking food out of my child\\'s mouth? By the way, I was supposed to be on a federal extension of unemployment benefits from when I was originally laid off. Why am I paying Texas back? Why am I not paying back the federal government back, since that is where the federal extension money comes from? If we are going to be letter of the law, we may as well be fair about where the money was coming from in the first place. I wish I had the time back. I spent looking for work while my parents were dying. Texas gets money back, but I will never get that time back with my parents. I want Texas to turn around and pay back the federal government the money I pay them. Thanks, TWC!

Hire a unemployment lawyer, no matter how small or how big of a reason to be terminated, get help, don't do this alone, there are free legal services in Texas as well that can help you. I found a lawyer just by actively speaking to lawyers, even if they couldn't take my case; and one of those lawyers recommended a great attorney who actually took my case for free. Very blessed I know, but you can expect to pay anywhere from $250 to $500 for a fee, can't charge over $500 ,and I'm sure you can work out the payment somehow.2. Continue to do your work searches, so when you win your case you'll receive back payments.3. Call TWC early in the morning. Call 800-939-6631 around 7am in the morning, and don't wait until the evening/afternoon. Wake up early in the morning and call when they first open. Each and every time I've called, someone answers right away.4. Do your research! Understand the law, understand unemployment terminology, and most importantly, understand the term misconduct and what that means to you. Google, do online research, and you'll find that the employers are winning because they know you don't understand unemployment law. They have to prove you willfully deliberately did an act to hinder productivity and put the employer's business at risk; this law is important. If you have documentation to back up your claims, that's great.5. Change your attitude. I know this is hard, but you have to remain calm. Yes, the employer can and will lie to win but don't allow that to get you upset during the tribunal hearing. Be calm and be cool, and hopefully, you'll have a lawyer who will handle all of the hard stuff and legal rambling. The lawyer will also cross-examine for you which is one of the most awesome feelings to catch an employer in a lie. If you go in by your self, you have to be ready and well-prepared. Some of the things we do like 65 pages of explanations on why you shouldn't be fired actually hurts your case.6. The reason why having 65 pages of explanations hurt your case is because you don't realize the tribunal hearing officer is looking for specific details such as warnings, proper write-ups, looking for signatures that you signed the document, also pay attention to signatures. Yes, the employer can and will falsify documents with your signature. The tribunal officer isn't interested in the rambling of what happened from A to Z; he or she is looking for specific details that show you knew you were doing something wrong--you knew you could get fired for it, and you did it any way.8. Don't do it alone; get some help. I know I said this before, but this is how I won my case and I couldn't be happier with the outcome. I felt confident knowing I had someone with me who was looking out for me, and I won and my lawyer was even able to get my employer to admit I wasn't deliberately not working. So winning is possible.This isn't much help, but it worked for me, especially getting a lawyer. Don't give up, and don't allow the employer to win; keep fighting for your money. Good luck, everyone.

This policy was called fraternizing if I spelled it correctly. Later research indicates that this policy indicates that no high level staff can date any employees in influence of scope. When I was interviewed by a high level staff in HR (Ms. ***) I was told that there were two young ladies complaining that I dated them and socializing on a social networking site which I had no idea what they were talking about. I immediately denied allegations and I requested details. Although, high level HR representative denied my request since all details are confidential and laughed at me indicating that they had proof such as text messages from my phone and comments on a social networking site. This interview took place in a small conference room with my manager and on-boarding supervisor with in my department of training on September 21, 2011 and it was for about 30 minutes. I later was sent back to continue my duties as a trainer. The following next day, two hours in my job, I get called into the same place to be told that the social networking site resulted not to be true, however, they were going to go by text messages that had came from my phone which I didn't have a clue what they were talking about to dismiss me. I again stated that I didn't have no clue what they were talking about and I politely ask for details because it was unfair being dismissed for allegations that are not true. That's when Supervisor *** stated that it was because I had reported unprofessional/misconduct behavior on several employees and retaliated against me. HR representative interrupted the on-boarding supervisor so that no more information was able to get out. On-boarding supervisor *** was then asked to walk me to the exit location and on the way out to the exit door. Supervisor *** apologized for everything and that it was not his decision but Candace *** simply because she didn't like me. The following day, went to my relative's home which whom I lend my phone out. I then find disturbing text messages indicating I was going to be fired from one of the accusers. That's when I figured out what was going. Former friends from the job site were upset that I almost caused someone's job due to bad behavior on a messenger from work and found out it was because I had reported. It didn't make no sense why I should have been discharged if I was doing my job. I immediately filed for unemployment benefits since I have a little 10 month old child to take care off. I had no idea I was going to receive a message notification on the unemployment website from Raymundo to contact him. I was waiting for some type of email or letter on the mail. So I called Telesev 800 number and I was told that since I didn't contact this individual my unemployment, benefits has been denied. I than logged online at the TWC payment request page to see what was going on. It stated that this gentleman tried to contact however that the attempt failed and therefore left a voice message. One thing though my cell phone does not have voice mail capability. This concludes that this gentleman clearly didn't make attempt to contact and favored the employer with no evidence. I then appealed however had a rescheduled appeal hearing because former employer didn't send me their proof to be disputed in the hearing. I then received packet notice along with former employers evidence which includes an altered document indicating of such policy that was never communicated to me with my signature on a different sheet of paper. It is clearly that my former employer provided a falsified document in which they violated certain penalty acts and statues. I'm just in disbelief that such employees from the TWC work in such a manner and that such decisions affect someone's life. Well I have a hearing on December 5, 2011 in the morning and which I have provided policy documents that I have signed and contacted several witnesses as far the young ladies comment to be false.

At first I was denied unemployment, but after months later, I ended up proving my case during the appeals process.  Also evidence came out during this hearing, which plainly suggested wrongful termination, but the TWC EEOC Division swept my case under the rug, and didn't even do anything, once the case was reviewed and accepted. This is another story.  So in June of 2011, I started working for Sonic Drive In in Fort Worth. I worked there for about 2 weeks.  I was scheduled for only 3 days (Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday).  On June 17th I was schedule to work, but the store manager sent me home, because she said it was slow. She also said that she had called and left me a message, telling me not to come, but that was a lie. I was a little upset because I did have to drive from Mesquite to the other side of Fort Worth. On Saturday morning, which was the 18th, I sprained my ankle at the gym.  I called the store, and informed the person in charge that I would not be able to make it it to work that night, and to leave a message for the store manager to call me back. This was around 11:00. At around 8:00 PM, I called back, and talked directly with the store manager. I asked her if she had gotten my message, she said no, and said that she thought I had quit. I explained to her that wasn't the case, and that I could return to work on my next usual day, which was Tuesday. So before I left to go to work on Tuesday, I called the store to make sure that I was still needed, because I didn't want to drive all the way to Fort Worth again, only to be turned around, like I was on Friday. The assistant manager told me that I was not even on the schedule anymore,  so I asked her to have the store manager call me.  A week went by, and I heard nothing, so I called again, the store manager was not there. I called again the next day, and I was told that the store manager was on vacation. I left messages both times. Needless to say I never heard from this employer again. I was using Emergency Unemployment benefits at the time, and since I wasn't a full time employee, I was still reporting my wages and hours, while I was working.  Around the first or second week in July, a message appeared on the TWC website, where I reported my wages to call a number because there were issues concerning my previous employer.  I called and talked to a lady and I told her that I wasn't working because I wasn't on the schedule anymore, and the employer hadn't returned any of my calls. So my benefits were approved. Then I get another call from someone else.  She didn't have any of my information written. She called and asked if my name was Jeffery **.  I said no, and gave here my name, and social. She asked if I had filed for unemployment. I said yes, back in April of 2010, and that was the end of that conversation. At the end of July I received my benefits check, and it stated that it was my last one, because I quit my job. So I had to appeal again.  It says that you have to wait 6 weeks for a hearing.  My first hearing wasn't schedule until October 11th, which was more than 10 weeks after the fact, and after I called to see what was going on. I called in on that date for my hearing, 30 minutes before like it stated. The lady took all of my information such as social and the number in which I could be reached for the hearing.  She stated that my hearing officer would call at or around my scheduled hearing time. No one ever called me so I assumed that the employer didn't call in. Two days later, the TWC website indicated that they affirmed the previous ruling. I immediately emailed everybody in the TWC office, and asked how could you render a decision, and I wasn't present. I asked if they were doing appeals hearings without the parties involved. The first response I got was that they tried contacting me several times, which was a lie, and that in order to get another hearing, I would have to appeal this decision, and show cause for another hearing. I emailed this person back and stated that I was not called at all about a hearing, so why would I have to prove anything.  The next day I received an email from someone higher than this person and he stated that a continuation of jurisdiction had been issued, so I could get another chance at this hearing. So a month later, November 15th, I had another hearing scheduled. I called in as usual and the officer called me for my hearing. The employer, however, did not call in. So we proceeded with the hearing.A few days later, I received a letter with the decision in it. The hearing was to cover three issues: whether I was entitled to EUC benefits, whether I was overpaid EUC benefits, and whether I qualified for a waiver of repayments for those benefits. So only one of the rulings was changed, which was the one in which, I am eligible to receive EUC benefits.  But in order to still receive the benefits, I would have to repay the amount they claim I was overpaid, because it stated that I didn’t do enough to protect my job. This also would mean that since I have been working since August, that I am not able to receive my EUC benefits. The section under the fact finding didn’t match up with what I had stated to the officer. The TWC is doing all it can not to have to pay people. All of them are crooked. I had phone records and everything to back up my story, and the employer didn’t even bother to phone in.  I did not quit my job, and if it was the employer making a claim against me, and I wouldn’t have phoned in, then I'm sure they would have taken their side. It is all unfair.

In Oct., my husband\\'s sales territory in Lubbock, TX was eliminated and he was offered a job in Tyler TX (he had to take it or lose his job and our health benefits). I had worked for my employer in retail for 4 years and had been an excellent employee (the owners words at our hearing). The position was in retail sales and I did not have daycare on Saturdays for my 6 yr. old daughter because my husband had to leave immediately for his new job (I had surgery on Wed. he had to report his new job the following Monday). I tried to find a state certified day that offered Saturday care but there were none in Lubbock. I even sent a list to TWC. I asked my supervisor if I could job share or work on Sundays ( a shorter day and less expensive to hire a private babysitter). Position was straight commission so I was the only one not benefiting by not working on Sat. but I was told they had never allowed anyone to skip Saturdays (I even offered to work one a month). I was forced to quit, told I no longer had a job. Filed with unemployment and was denied time and again even while citing a precedent that had been set in a previous case (the state says that if there is not adequate care for an underage child, the employer must amend the schedule). I still could have worked 40 hours a week without working Saturdays, but time and again I was denied unemployment because I quit for no reason. Mr. *** even said he didn\\'t fire me I was an excellent employee, but he also agreed that I was not allowed to work there if I didn\\'t work on Saturdays. TWC kept denying my claims and finally I had 14 days to find legal representation and could not find anyone in Lubbock willing to take my case. I still feel very strongly that I was unfairly denied benefits. Later that year, when many of his employees had quit, Mr. *** called back one of his old employees to work \"part time\" even tho\\' he said he had never allowed parttime employees (and in fact he had in the past). He lied to TWC and TWC didn\\'t care about any prior rulings, they were going to deny me benefits no matter what. It\\'s all a sham. Employees pay into unemployment funds and never get to collect.

I have never seen my position description and after 9 months of my employment, I called U.S. Department of Labor asking what do I need to do. The lady on the phone responded that she is on duty and is not accepting stupid phone calls because this is impossible. When I reassured her that this is true, she said that in 20 years of her employment with US Department of Labor, she had never heard about employee not having his position description for 9 months of employment! Once, I asked my employer to provide the position description and started a complaint about a misconduct that his relative was engaged in, they arranged meeting of three against one, and said they found some mistakes in the reports I have been reviewing. I decided to quit this horrible employment, but when excruciating pain hit my back, I went to the doctor and he excused me from work for the entire week.

My appeal with 85 pages of supporting documentation was simply ignored and I never had a chance to open my mouth and say what happened.

I appealed the decision to the Commission; however my appeal with detailed analysis and supporting documents of 65 pages total was ignored by Texas Workforce Commission saying that they affirm Appeal Tribunal decision in all aspects. This was only sentence in the Commissions decision and I can only assume they did this on purpose just to keep money in house. Now both: the employer and the Commission can keep money in house, and to my opinion, all these proceedings were used to cover their unlawful decisions much like the fig leaf to cover the nudity. They use them in any way which is convenient to them and to the employer turning up and down and reversing like a sock just to keep employers' ** saved and to not pay the money for people who are in need to get them.The hearing officer was dumb annoying arrogant and not able to understand things that every third grade kid would easily pick up. He was unbelievably rude when talking with me in cutting my answers halfway and treating me like a criminal prisoner, but he was so sweet with my employer and so helpful in telling my employer what to say, what to ask, advising him to submit termination letter (employer forgot to submit it to the commission) because they both: my employer and TWC had one goal: to prove I have committed misconduct! Everything was just a matter of how to ask the questions, as for example if you would asked, have you ever been told you have committed misconduct? They will push you hard until you say you have seen this in termination letter. Once you said this, they are considering this an evidence of misconduct.I definitely think that TWC should be released off duty and that it is our fault they are still crashing people's lives and being paid salaries out of tax money.

He also asked me, “Was I able to find another assignment since my last assignment ended?” I informed him that I started another assignment on July 11, 2011. He apologized and said he would research this situation more because he was not the one who completed the paperwork to TWC. I informed him that I would be appealing the decision.  My employment benefits are not from the temp agency. My unemployment benefits are from a previous employer, where I was laid off from my job on April 29, 2011. According to TWC’s \"How Temporary Work Affects Your Unemployment\", I followed TWC guidelines.Temporary work is just what is says, temporary work. When an assignment ends and the agency does not have another assignment for you, what are you supposed to do? Keep waiting and turn down a job offer?

The owner discredited his own story and that of the two other employees during the hearing by blatantly stating something opposite of his prior statements multiple times and they were not able to determine that he was lying.When they sent the determination packet to my house, it had the summary of the trial included. The people got names wrong and information was severely askew. They twisted my words around to make it sound like I had said something I did not say. They just put down their own version of the story. They didn\\'t even get my gender correct! They kept referring to me as \"she\"!

I stated it was not a work-related reason. Now can I ask you and any of them if the shoe was on a different foot, would you not drop everything to do what I needed to do? I worked for a very unfriendly and unsanitary place with the 4-letter word rhyming with truck spoken within the first 30 minutes of my first day of employment here in Illinois for the 6-week required period which I could not refuse because of the aforementioned appeal. Driving 90 miles a day for $10.00 an hour with gas prices being as what they are. Now I received a notification stating that I quit my job because of the work conditions. I was told to leave and file unemployment by the president of the company, job was falsely advertised. I was lied to by this so-called employer.I have been in debt and about to lose my vehicle, my credit is ruined and will not be able to get back into my field of work because they run credit reports, and can't get my prescription filled for seizures.

I worked one day that week and one day the following week. The next two weeks, I did not work because there was no request from the employer. When I made a payment request on December 26, the computer put it on hold (due to no work claimed). When I spoke with someone at Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) and explained that I still worked for this company, but they did not use me the last two weeks, I made a foolish mistake of talking freely with her about the hours I worked, and having to take a cab back to where I reside and the expense of it.  She asked if I still worked there, and I said, “Yes, I am still employed there.” She then stated she has to send a letter to the employer. I told her I had no problem with that. She also stated she would release the funds that day, and I would receive it within two to three business days. No funds were made three days later (Thursday). When I called TWC back and I spoke with another person, they said it was still on hold. They are waiting for the reply from the employer, who had replied on the 11th of January 2011. They did receive a response from the employer on the 11th, which indicated that I was not on laid off; meaning, I still worked for them. We began to discuss the transportation issue of the cab. I once again informed them that I still worked for this company (Corpus Christi Nursing and Rehab), and the cab issue was only about how much it cost, and I still worked for the employer. Later that day, I noticed on the TWC website that I was disqualified for benefits because I quit from my job. That was a lie. When I called them back on December 31, 2010 thinking they received something back from the employer, I was informed I was disqualified base on my statements only, and the employer had not responded yet. I was shocked! I never told anyone on any phone conversation that I quit on the job. In fact, I still worked there. I did some research on Texas law, and I found the Texas Labor Code, section 208.023, regarding a request for redetermination. The law provides that the re-determination is the appeal. When I looked at the law (through the Internet), this is how it was worded, “A claimant within 14 days after the date the commission mailed notice of the commission's determination to the claimant under section 208.022, may request a redetermination of, or may appeal the commission's determination of the validity of an initial claim in the manner provided by chapter 212.”  I see that these are two different things--the appeal and the redetermination. What I was told over the phone was there was no re-determination.I am now facing homelessness, and I am going to a shelter. I have no funds now to seek employment out of my current city, and I have already set up two interviews in other towns that I will now have to cancel due to the lies of the TWC and them falsifying my statements I gave over the phone. Due to being hard of hearing, I often times record conversations to play back later to make sure I understood them. I did record the conversations, but erased them not thinking this was going to be a problem, now I wish I hadn't What else can I do beside the appeal?

I left a job at a bad time in August 2008 and I was approved for benefits. I promptly found a part time position that didn't pay nearly as well but kept me busy while I searched for full time work. Because of the pay and hours however, I was still able to collect unemployment benefits. In August 2009, I renewed my application for benefits and was approved with no problem. In June 2010, when Congress did not act to extend benefits, I fell behind on my rent and I got evicted from my apartment. During this process, I had talked with my manager and together we determined that it would be best for me to resign and look for work elsewhere that would pay my bills. I resigned at the end of June and moved to Oregon to help out a friend. I thought that once Congress approved the benefits again, I would be able to have enough to complete my move to Seattle where I had spoken with several agencies who told me that they had plenty of jobs that I would qualify for, once I got there. Well, when benefits were finally restored, I got a payment for those weeks, and then I got a letter saying that I needed to re-qualify. I went through that and my application was denied. I waited several weeks and then TWC called me to apply for benefits under my last employer. We did all that on the phone and the person taking my information said that there should be no problem. I got a call a few days later from an investigator who asked why I had left. I told him that I was being evicted and had no other place to go. He had the gall to say that I should have moved into a homeless shelter. When I got my determination, I was denied benefits. I had to send in three appeal requests before one was finally acknowledged. I had my hearing and told the officer that I left because I was being evicted, attached are copies of the legal notices, and that I had contacted both my manager and some agencies up here that said they had jobs. My hearing was on the 1st of December and I got my determination today, December 9, again, denied. Was I supposed to live on the streets with my kids? As it is, the kids are still in Texas and I am up here in Oregon still looking for work. I tried contacting the Senators and Representative from my district, only to get canned e-mail responses from one senator, no response from the other and I am unable to contact the representative, as his site isn't working properly! You know, if they would just send me that money, I would be out of their hair. With the money in hand, I can finish my move to Seattle and be working so they would not have to pay anymore benefits!

I keep my TWC records updated, yet they keep placing job leads that makes me look low skilled with no education.  I do not have any disabilities, but the jobs they place in my job bank, makes me look as if I do.  After my last experience, I am afraid to even use TWC job leads. I\\'m not **, and neither do I have any disabilities. I am afraid to even respond to their jobs, because I don\\'t know who they are sending me to. Even after, starting my own business, launching it this year before the public eye, TWC still ignores all of my qualifications. To me it\\'s discrimination.Why can\\'t they forward a suitable job lead to me? I have utilized the proper key words, they teach you that in job seeking, job training seminars.  And by the way, who says I can\\'t continue to grow my own business while still working for an employer, as long as it does not affect my performance with the other employer? My business can be my part-time job. One, while someone at TWC had pulled me from the job bank, reasoning that I had my own business.  Well, just because you are trying to grow your business, does not mean the business is profitable or self-sufficient yet.  My business was and still is not in a position to support me, my child, or itself (with capital gains). I am still taking a loss.However, for me to understand the various functions in a business should tell TWC, that I am not just a telemarketer. I have even attended graduate classes here in Texas. It can be quite frustrating, when you are trying to support your household. You try supporting your household with minimal wages, and working these part-time jobs. If I could find a decent job, then I can do better, and my business can do better. Most of your job force is supported by people trying to run a small business. If mine could get out of the starting stage, maybe I could help TWC provide jobs for other people.  Think about it.  Stop trying to keep me down, and allow a person to grow and progress, so that we all can take a bite out of the 9.6% unemployment rate. I have been deprived of life, trying to live down here in Texas. I am ready to move to another state, considering how I have been treated.

I am currently still unemployed now over two years. Through the Obama Stimulus package, I was allowed a couple extensions after my benefits had exhausted. I worked for what I was told similar to a day labor job delivering phone books for less than one day. Due to the physical demands of unpacking and re-bagging then delivering and completed my SUV load over 250 white and yellow pages in 6 1/2 hrs. However I was not able to continue my 2nd and final load the following day due to muscle spasms. After a brief conversation with the company clerk, I was told my check would be mailed (which resulted in a payment of $46.31) and I was out the door. Now the horror begins! Following the rules of TWC, I reported the less than 8 hours worked and my claims from January-June 2010 were placed on hold. Per TWC the company had reported I quit thereby no further benefits were being allowed! I was advised of my appeal rights and continue to file once a ruling was determined. My first appeal was denied and I requested a hearing (2nd appeal) which took over 3 months as I was told my assigned agent was not available on my hearing date and it needed to be rescheduled! All the while I had no finances to sustain my daily living. The hearing was eventually held and I was to receive a decision by mail of which no letter was ever received however all withheld benefit payments from January-June 2010 were released and I assume this was their decision. I was wrong! I received a letter dated August 24th, requesting an overpayment for the released payment from January-June stating benefits were paid in error!

We take all customers up until closing time, regardless of the job length required.When I was denied unemployment benefits, I received a notice stating that I did not respond in a timely manner and the claim was being paid. This is incorrect. Not only did I speak to a representative, I also faxed them all requested information. I appealed this once again and a phone hearing was set. I later received a letter stating that the standing remains the same and the employee will still be receiving benefits. After carefully reading this report written by TWC, I noticed several discrepancies. In several paragraphs, it references that there was a four month gap from the time of employee’s last precipitating incident and employee’s termination date. This statement is untrue. From the final notice meeting held December 7th, 2009 until the date employee’s job was posted for replacement on January 15th, 2010, there was only a one month gap. Since we are not a large company with multiple employees, and only have two men on our sales team, it was imperative that the employee’s position was replaced before he was terminated. A replacement was found on February 19, 2010, the same day the employee was terminated, once again leaving only a one month gap. This totals only 2 months in total from the time the employee was placed on probation and the day he was terminated. Another paragraph stated that the act of misconduct on the claimant\\'s part was shown three months prior to the claimant\\'s discharge, which is also an incorrect statement. The samples send into TWC were all dated in the month of January 2010, some of which dated January 28, 2010, which is only a little over two weeks prior to the claimant’s discharge. I only sent in very few samples because I did not feel it necessary to send hundreds of samples proving the same thing. I have samples that dates all the way up to the date of termination if needed. Under section 201.012, it states the act’s definitions of misconduct. The employee’s actions were classified as an unconscionable act of an employee or supervisor. This is also incorrect. I am certain that the forgery, theft of goods and failure to comply with company procedures would fall under intentional wrongdoing or malfeasance, intentional violation of law or violation of a policy or rule adopted to ensure the orderly work. All of these things listed above were admitted by the employee on the phone hearing held on April 27, 2010. The TWC does not agree with the fact that forgery or theft is a direct violation of the Texas law.I contacted TWC to see where I could submit the video monitor systems and recording tapes as proof and evidence of such misconduct. I was told that the TWC will not review nor will they accept such tapes. This comes as a great surprise to me since the tape would show 100% fault of work-related misconduct. The employee has openly admitted of his intent to intentionally get \"let go\" in order to work with his brother at a business, which employee is an investor of and has been receiving monthly income from for several years now for \"cash\" so he could still receive unemployment benefits and his pregnant wife would then qualify for Medicaid benefits. I am appalled at the way the TWC conducts their investigations and gathers their information. TWC allows claimants to intentionally break the law and company policy with the intention to get fired so that they can unlawfully receive unemployment benefits, Medicaid Benefits and work for \"cash\" while evading the IRS on their responsibility to pay income tax. If TWC would have reviewed my tape as evidence, there would be no question as to why the employee was terminated. If TWC would audit employee’s bank statements, they would also see that he has been receiving income from Horsepower Engineering in which he is not claiming as income. The employee just purchased a brand new 2010 Ford F-150 extended cab truck 3 weeks ago. If TWC would investigate that and figure out how financing was obtained to an individual on an unemployment salary with a pregnant, non-working spouse and two other children. I do realize that TWC has several cases and it would be impossible to review each one on case by case bases. However, with violation of law that the former employee has admitted to doing as well as the blatant disregard to follow company guidelines and procedures also admitted, I do not see how the TWC could justify this to being anything less than work misconduct.\\n                    View more\\n                ', 'label': 'neutral', 'neg_prob': 0.6319358002480788, 'neutral_prob': 0.8535076069333231, 'pos_prob': 0.3680641997519212}, 162: {'text': 'Original review: July 25, 2010I was granted unemployment benefits after being fired from my former employer on February 24, 2010.

Texas Workforce stated they made several attempts to reach me and left a voice mail stating if I didn\\'t reach them. I did not receive such a voice mail, but during the times they said they made this call, I did receive numerous hung-ups, when I answered my home phone (Not to mention, I requested they call me on my cell phone due to job hunting). So since I couldn\\'t be reached, they made a decision to uphold denying me benefits--a finding towards the employer.The employer didn\\'t inform me as to why I was being terminated; I never received any type of corrective action since my tenure (which is close to 3 years) with the company (Sprint). Not to mention, I was interviewed for a position in management the day before. When I received my hearing packet and noticed documents that couldn\\'t be deciphered, my former employer did not cooperate in providing crucial information from my employee file (such as employee evaluations, clock times, employee trainings, and any corrective actions taken since my employment with the company). I was told that such would be passed on to their legal department, and it could take up to five business days. Once I finished the conversation with the former employer, I called the assigned TWC H.O. (Mrs. **) once again to ask to reschedule and that the former employer is not cooperating again and if they could be subpoenaed for the documents. I received no return call. It stated:\"Your tribunal hearing -- Information & Instructions --- Schedule conflicts/Hearing postponements are not ordinarily granted. However, If you have a justifiable conflict, notify the hearing officer as soon as possible before your hearing.

If there\\'s new evidence that\\'s critical to the claimant\\'s case that the employer can only access, is there a point of contact that can be reached, or if at all possible, to leave a message to be contacted to answer or give clarity prior to the hearing date?\"I performed my duties to the best of my ability for close to three years, and during that time, I only received praise from my managers, leaders, customers, as well as my peers. I\\'m confident with this new  existing evidence: testimonials from managers and employee evaluations which showed nothing less than integrity, loyalty, commitment, and dedication to the company; and co-workers who were present and key customer witnesses to testify on behalf of these frivolous, demeaning, and slanderous charges brought against me due to retaliation for reporting potential wrongdoings that I brought to my store manager only to be fired in the process months later. \"This is why it is only fair to reopen this case. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.\"After this, I received another hearing officer (Mr. **)  with whom the hearing was set for the 1st of July 2010. At the hearing, I was told Mr. ** testified that \"I\\'m not doubting you made the calls to Mrs. ** prior to the hearing.\" During that hearing, he also requested the information I had asked Mrs. ** and my former employer which they informed him they didn\\'t have. Mr. ** stated that he would give them time to produce this information and have a continuous of this hearing. But he didn\\'t do a continuous. He provided by mail a packet; it showed the former employer\\'s address. It also showed that the packet was sent in copies to the district manager\\'s home address who fired me. In addition to that, it showed a Page 3C of the issues in the hearing which stated \"Notice of resetting. A timely request for a new hearing has been made under the provision of Rule 16 of the Texas Workforce Commission.\"Once again, a hearing date was established for the 21st of July 2010. On this day, the former employer did not show nor did they provide Mr. ** with the documents he requested. Even so, Mr. ** proceeded with the hearing without the former employer. After that, he notified me the decision would be mailed to my address. When I received the decision which it was found that I didn\\'t have an emergency on the hearing, therefore the claim to reopen is denied. So, proving that the former employer did fire unjustly means nothing. For you to have called your appointed hearing officer well over seven times to notify as soon as possible before your hearing of conflicts with your former employer of this new evidence.

And the fact that it marks the 6th month that the Texas Workforce Commission has not assisted/subpoenaed/answered a simple phone call or voice mail message to be notified of the new evidence that you inform us to do.Now that makes the 4th time that Case #1289522 Claimant and Employer: Sprint-United Co. has been sent not to the former employer HR or Legal Department, but to a private home. It marked twice that Sheila ** denied hearing officer Mr. ** of TWC any information of the claimant\\'s employment, evaluation, any corrective action documents, and/or any training on the matters in question. Employer has denied Texas Workforce Commission of this new evidence, denied documents that they cannot provide from a private address. Knowing if its former employer (corporation) had knowledge of someone other than its Legal Department. Instead, the Texas Workforce Commission hearing officer told me when I reached him that he could not talk to me about the case and ended his call.Then on the day of the appeal\\'s hearing, I informed Mr. ** of my witnesses who will prove that the SPRINT-UNITED Documents you were sending to a personal address is not where their corporate office is located. But once again, the hearing officer said he was not disputing my witnesses testimony and there would be no need for my witnesses\\' testimony.

If your employer lied to the TWC saying that you walked away from the job when it was available for you, when you were fired, expect the following.An investigation will take about 3 months. The investigator will call you. Expect the investigator to be rude and manipulative (in favor of the Employer). The investigator will interrupt you and tell you to answer the question, meaning a short answer. Make sure that the investigator took note of your answer. Most likely your unemployment benefits will be denied. So, you need to appeal. When you appeal, make sure to send to the TWC all the documents that support your side. Send it via certified mail. If you need some documents from your employer, request it, first for the employer. Again, request via certified mail, after that, request a subpoena to the Hearing officer explaining why you need the document and also let the officer know that you tried to contact the employer.During the hearing, expect that the hearing officer will be very rude with you and very nice and polite with the employer. The hearing officer will help the employer but will not help or listen to you. Make sure to make questions to the employer that will support your view. Most of the time, the employer will contradict himself because of the lies. In the end, the hearing officer will let you do the final statements; make sure to point out the contradictions. You will win the unemployment benefits only if you have documents that show that you were fired. The Hearing officer will not consider your words.

They did not turn me down because of my absence for other work which was fulltime.If infact I did just stop working with them because I wanted to maximize my job search for fulltime work in November 2003, in which I worked one day about every ten days, why would I be able to receive an assignment by them after my ten day absence?! Because I am not required to report back.Carmen also stated in that letter she sent me that(B and M Limited)allegedly told me that failure to report back would result in a lost of benefits.That is a lie. They never told me that, neither did they have knowledge that I was receiving unemployment benefits.She did an improper investigation.I believe that she fabricated these alleged statements by(B and M Limted)in the inquiry.The bottom line is that I did not quit. It is my choice, like everyone\\'s,to reutrn back at a time that was suitable for me. In the Unemployment information that was sent to me it stated that \"I had to find fulltime work\" I can\\'t find fulltime work if I was wasting my time at a day labor job. What is more is that I,like everyone else, can make our own schedule.Carmen  deserves to lose her job for fabricating the statements by(B and M limted) or for perfoming an improper investigation.\\n                    View more\\n                \\n   ', 'label': 'neutral', 'neg_prob': 0.848568395650058, 'neutral_prob': 0.887401628909525, 'pos_prob': 0.15143160434994193}, 181: {'text': 'Original review: Sept. 22, 2003   I was denied unemployment compensation.  Mr.Legaspi informed me that it was not required of him to inform the employees of St.Philip School that non-profit organizations are exempt from paying unemployment taxes and thus employees are not eligible for unemployment compensation. However after my appeal this a poicy was immediately put into effect by St. Philip School that employees would from this time foreward be informed.  I am filing a second appeal at this time against the Texas Workforce Commission.  I belive that it is their legal and lawful duty to inform Texas employees of this matter.  In their eligibility requirements is there no mention of this issue.  I have worked hard all of my life and paid taxes forever.

I talked to my local office in Dallas who said the checks were not cashed or returned to the State.  They had to refer me to the State office in Austin.  I have talked to several people there-with varying stories on how to get my checks.  My mother happens to live in Austin, I arranged to have them prepare the checks for me to pick up directly. Once I got there, I was told the policy had changed and checks had to be mailed.  I finally got Richard Stevens in Commission Disbursements in July-that he was the person to rectify the problem.  He said he already had my file, about the fourth in his workload and it is usually 1-2 days per file.  Usually when I have called to follow-up, I am left with voice mail.  If I talk to an operator, I am told he is the only person that can help me.

That's what we get for living in Texas, I guess. Well, not anymore. TX want to play games with people's fundamental rights. We will be moving to a state that respects and treats their workforce with dignity. Thanks, TX... for teaching us how not to act.\""
