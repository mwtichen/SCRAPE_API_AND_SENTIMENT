# Scraping Reviews and Classifying them using a Web API

In this project, I scraped reviews from the [Consumer Affairs](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/) website, then sent the text to a web API to get a classification of each review (either positive, negative or neutral).

Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/mwtichen/SCRAPE_API_AND_SENTIMENT/blob/master/SCRAPE_API_AND_SENTIMENT.ipynb).

If you are on a mobile phone, be sure to click on Desktop Version at the bottom of the screen.
